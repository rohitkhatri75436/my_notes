# Machine leanring
## There are three types of machine learning

* Supervised Machine Learning
* Unsupervised Machine Learning
* Re-inforcement

# Supervised Machine Learning:
> In __supervised learning__ we provide __actual result/lables__ to program so it can check the __difference between actual result and its own predictions__.

### There are two types of Supervised Machine Learning:
1. Regression (Over Number)
2. Classification (Over Category/Class)

### Regression: 
> in __Regression__ the program try to predict in __infinite numbers of possibilities__.
### Classification: 
> in __Classification__ the program try to predicts __category/class.__ For example __binary classification (true/false or 0/1)__, or __Cat or Dog__ or __a finite number(0,1,2)__.
